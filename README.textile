This build workspace system is tailored to debian/ubuntu.

= Initial setup =

* run the script 'initialize' - it will install required packages
* regularily run 'sync-workspace' to fetch all (enabled) source repos
** the individual package repositories will be stored under pkg/
* setup pbuilder: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/PbuilderHowto
* to build for Debian on Ubuntu, install: debian-archive-keyring

= Package configs and syncing =

* package configs are placed under cf/packages/
* by default, no packages are configured - instead the configs are placed under cf/packages-available/
* to enable packages, symlink the corresponding configs from cf/packages-available/ into cf/packages/

= Building individual packages =

* you'll need to checkout proper branches first
* target distro guessed from branch name prefix (eg. for 'precise/')
* for each package there's an individual build-* script
* built binary packages are put into the apt repository in ./aptrepo/

= Using the aptrepo locally =

* add it to your /etc/apt/sources.list
* for example: deb file:///<path_to_workspace>/aptrepo precise main testing experimental
